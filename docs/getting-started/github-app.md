The GlueOps Platform utilizes a GitHub App to access your GitHub Organizations to provide the following services:

* Deployment of Tenant Applications via a [tenant-stack-repository](https://github.com/GlueOps/platform-helm-chart-platform/blob/main/templates/argocd-tenant-configs.yaml)
* Pull Request comments, generated by the [pull-request-bot](https://github.com/GlueOps/pull-request-bot), to display helpful links associated with preview environments.

## Create the GitHub App ID

   - **GitHub App name**: Choose a unique name for your GitHub App. We recommend using a combination of your organization name and "GlueOps" for easy identification

   - **Webhook**: Disable the "Active" option for webhooks, as they are not currently required by the GitHub App.

   - **Permissions**: Grant the following repository permissions to the GitHub App:
     - `Contents`: Read and write
     - `Discussions`: Read and write
     - `Issues`: Read and write
     - `Metadata`: Read-only (mandatory)
     - `Pull requests`: Read and write

   - **Where can this GitHub App be installed?**: Select "Only on this account." This limits the GitHub App to your organization.
