# Creating your GitHub App

The GlueOps Platform utilizes a GitHub App to access your GitHub Organizations to provide the following services:

* Deployment of Tenant Applications via a [deployment-configurations](https://github.com/GlueOps/deployment-configurations) repository
* Pull Request comments, generated by the [pull-request-bot](https://github.com/GlueOps/pull-request-bot), to display helpful links associated with preview environments.

To enable GlueOps access to your GitHub organization, you will need to provide the following values:

- [github_tenant_app_id](#create-the-github-app-id)
- [github_tenant_app_b64enc_private_key](#generate-the-private-key)
- [github_tenant_app_installation_id](#get-installation-id)

:::info
For each cluster you deploy with the GlueOps platform, create a separate GitHub app and name it accordingly.
:::

Follow the step-by-step guide below to obtain these values:

## 1. Create the GitHub App ID

To create the GitHub App, follow these steps:

1. On your Github Organization page, go to the **Settings > Developer settings** and click on **GitHub Apps**.

3. Configure the application by providing the following details:

   - **GitHub App name**: Choose a unique name for your GitHub App. We recommend using a combination of your organization name and "GlueOps" for easy identification

   - **Homepage URL**: Specify the URL for the GitHub App's homepage. You can use any URL, but we suggest using https://glueops.dev for consistency.

   - **Webhook**: Disable the "Active" option for webhooks, as they are not currently required by the GitHub App.

   - **Permissions**: Grant the following repository permissions to the GitHub App:
     - `Contents`: Read and write
     - `Discussions`: Read and write
     - `Issues`: Read and write
     - `Metadata`: Read-only (mandatory)
     - `Pull requests`: Read and write

   - **Where can this GitHub App be installed?**: Select "Only on this account." This limits the GitHub App to your organization.

3. Click on **Create GitHub App** to create the GitHub App with the provided configuration.

4. After creating the GitHub App, you will be provided with an **App ID**.

## 2. Generate the private key

To generate the private key for your GitHub App, follow these steps:

- On the GitHub App's homepage, select **Generate a private key** This will download a private key file.

- Open the downloaded key file and generate a Base64-encoded version using the following command:

```
cat <downloaded-keyfile>.pem | base64 -w 0
```
Replace `<downloaded-keyfile>` with the actual name of the downloaded key file.

:::info
For macbook users run `cat <downloaded-keyfile>.pem | base64`

## 3. Add Display logo(Optional)
Adding logo to your GitHub App ensures that when our bot comments it'll use the image for easy identification. To add the logo:

- Save and download the GlueOps logo image

- On the GitHub App's homepage, locate the **Display Information** section and click on **Upload logo**

:::info
You can also upload your own custom image if desired.

## 4. Get Installation ID

To complete the GitHub App setup, you need to install the GitHub App in your organization. 

- In the left side of the GitHub App's homepage, click on **Install App**

<img width="544" alt="Screenshot 2023-07-19 at 14 35 59" src="https://github.com/GlueOps/glueops-dev/assets/39309699/c593a23a-bb5b-479e-b39f-8956e10188c7"/>

- Confirm the installation by following the on-screen prompts.

- This ID can be retrieved from the URL of the App installation homepage

:::info
If your GitHub organization is "glueops-rocks," the URL would be `https://github.com/organizations/glueops-rocks/settings/installations/12345678`, and the GitHub App Installation ID would be `12345678`.
:::

## Retrieving values

By completing the above steps, you should have obtained the following values from the GitHub App:

- [github_tenant_app_id](#create-the-github-app-id)
- [github_tenant_app_b64enc_private_key](#generate-the-private-key)
- [github_tenant_app_installation_id](#get-installation-id)

These values will be used when deploying your application with Glueops.
