# Creating your GitHub App

The GlueOps Platform utilizes a GitHub App to access your GitHub Organizations to provide the following services:

* Deployment of Tenant Applications via a [deployment-configurations](https://github.com/GlueOps/deployment-configurations) repository
* Pull Request comments, generated by the [pull-request-bot](https://github.com/GlueOps/pull-request-bot), to display helpful links associated with preview environments.

To enable GlueOps access to your GitHub organization, you will need to provide the following values:

- [github_tenant_app_id](#create-the-github-app-id)
- [github_tenant_app_b64enc_private_key](#generate-the-private-key)
- [github_tenant_app_installation_id](#get-installation-id)

:::info
For each cluster you deploy with the GlueOps platform, create a separate GitHub app and name it accordingly.
:::

Follow the step-by-step guide below to obtain these values:

## 1. Create the GitHub App ID

To create the GitHub App, follow these steps:

1. On your Github Organization page, go to the **Settings > Developer settings** and click on **GitHub Apps**.

3. Configure the application by providing the following details:

   - **GitHub App name**: Your Github App name is usually the `captain_domain` provided by GlueOps. The `captain_domain` is the domain part that identifies your cluster

   - **Homepage URL**: Specify the URL for the GitHub App's homepage. We suggest using https://glueops.dev for consistency.

For example, let's assume we have a client called **Neptune**:
   
   - **GitHub App Name**: `test-nonprod.neptune.onglueops.com` which is the `captain_domain`(the domain part that identifies your cluster). 

   - **Homepage URL**: `https://glueops.dev`

4. Deselect Active as Webhooks are not currently required by the GitHub App.

5. Set the following repository permissions to the GitHub App
   - **Permissions**: Grant the following repository permissions to the GitHub App:
     - `Contents`: Read and write
     - `Discussions`: Read and write
     - `Issues`: Read and write
     - `Metadata`: Read-only (mandatory)
     - `Pull requests`: Read and write

   - **Where can this GitHub App be installed?**: Select "Only on this account." This limits the GitHub App to your organization.

6. Click on **Create GitHub App** to create the GitHub App with the provided configuration.

4. After creating the GitHub App, you will be provided with an **App ID**.

## 2. Generate the private key

To generate the private key for your GitHub App, follow these steps:

- On the GitHub App's homepage, scroll down to **Private keys** section

- Click on **Generate a private key**. This will download a private key file.

- Open the downloaded key file and generate a Base64-encoded version using the following command:

```
cat <downloaded-keyfile>.pem | base64 -w 0
```
Replace `<downloaded-keyfile>` with the actual name of the downloaded key file.

:::info
For macbook users run `cat <downloaded-keyfile>.pem | base64`

## 3. Add Display logo(Optional)
Adding logo to your GitHub App ensures that when our bot comments it'll use the image for easy identification. To add the logo:

- Save and download the GlueOps logo image

Once uploaded, this is the final outcome

:::info
From the URL would be `https://github.com/organizations/venkata-tenant-test-1/settings/installations/40078841` the GitHub App Installation ID would be `4007884`.

## Retrieving values

By completing the above steps, you should have obtained the following values from the GitHub App:

- [github_tenant_app_id](#create-the-github-app-id)
- [github_tenant_app_b64enc_private_key](#generate-the-private-key)
- [github_tenant_app_installation_id](#get-installation-id)
